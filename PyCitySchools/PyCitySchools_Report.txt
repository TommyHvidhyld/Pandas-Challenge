PyCity is a district of fifteen total schools with 39,170 students and a total budget of just over 24.5 million dollars. I ran analysis on this district to discover trends on reading, math, and overall scores on standardized tests. Overall scores were a combination of reading and math scores. The district as a whole produced an average math score of 78.9 and average reading score of 81.9. The percentage of students passing math was 75%; reading 86%; and an overall passing percentage of 65%.
Next I broke the numbers down by school. The top three schools based on the overall passing percentage were Cabrera High School, Thomas High School, and Griffin High School with passing percentages respectively of 91.3%, 90.9%, and 90.6%. All three of these schools were charter schools. The bottom three schools were Roriguez High, Figueroa High, and Huang High with percentages respectively of 52.9%, 53.2%, and 53.5%. These three schools were district schools. Scores were then broken down by grade for both math and reading.
Then I created a table that added additional information of budget spending range per student. Four schools came in at less than $585 per student, each were charter. Two schools came in at the highest range of $645-680, both district. Information of scores and passing percentages based on the spending ranges was put into a table as well. Overall Passing percentages decreased as spending ranges per student increased. The same applyes for all math and reading scores.
School size was the next table created. The schools were divided into small(<1000), medium(1000-2000), and large(2000-5000). The overall passing percentage of small schools was 89.9% and medium schools had 90.6%, with a significant dropoff at large schools with 58.3%.
Charter schools performed better than district schools in all areas: math, reading, and overall. Overall passing percentage was 90.4% for charter schools versus 53.7% for district schools.
